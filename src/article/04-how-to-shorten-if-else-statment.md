Say no more to `if..else` statment when you doesn't really need it, you can actually make it one line


### long hand
```
const x = 10;
let answer;
if(x > 3) {
    answer = 'more than 3'
}else{
    answer ='less than 3'
}
```

### sort hand 
```
const answer = x > 10 ? 'more than 3' : 'less than 3';
```
